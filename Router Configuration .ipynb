    "### 1. **Access the Router**\n",
    "   - When you first connect to a router, you are in **user EXEC mode**. This mode allows you to view limited information but not make changes.\n",
    "   - Typing **`enable`** takes you to **privileged EXEC mode**, where you can execute more powerful commands. You’ll often need a password to enter this mode, especially if it has been configured for security.\n",
    "   - The prompt changes from `Router>` to `Router#`, indicating you’re in privileged mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Enter Global Configuration Mode**\n",
    "   - Global Configuration Mode allows you to configure settings that affect the entire router.\n",
    "   - Enter **`configure terminal`** from privileged EXEC mode. This takes you to a mode where you can configure system-wide settings.\n",
    "   - The prompt will change to `Router(config)#`, signaling that you are now in global configuration mode.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### 3. **Set the Router's Hostname**\n",
    "   - **Hostname** is the name of the router and is helpful in identifying devices within a network, especially if you manage multiple routers.\n",
    "   - Use the command **`hostname MyRouter`**, replacing `MyRouter` with your desired name. This name will appear in the prompt, like `MyRouter(config)#`.\n",
    "   - The hostname change is immediate and only needs to be saved if you want it to persist after a reboot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Configure Passwords**\n",
    "   - **Enable Password**: This password is used to secure privileged EXEC mode. Use **`enable password your_password`** to set it, replacing `your_password` with the desired password.\n",
    "   - **Enable Secret Password**: This is a more secure, encrypted password for privileged EXEC access. It takes precedence over the enable password. \n",
    "   - Set it using **`enable secret your_secret_password`**. Replace `your_secret_password` with your chosen password.\n",
    "   - Both passwords are crucial for security, especially in a multi-user environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Configure Console and VTY (Telnet/SSH) Passwords**\n",
    "   - **Console Password**: This password secures access to the router’s console port, which is the physical connection to the device.\n",
    "     - Use **`line console 0`** to enter console line configuration mode.\n",
    "     - Then, set a password with **`password console_password`** and enable login with **`login`**.\n",
    "     - Type **`exit`** to return to global configuration mode.\n",
    "   - **VTY (Virtual Teletype) Password**: This password is for remote access, commonly used with Telnet or SSH.\n",
    "     - Enter **`line vty 0 4`** to configure VTY lines for remote connections.\n",
    "     - Set a password with **`password vty_password`** and enable login with **`login`**.\n",
    "     - Exit the line configuration mode with **`exit`**.\n",
    "   - Setting these passwords ensures that only authorized users can access the router, either locally (console) or remotely (VTY).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Configure an Interface (e.g., FastEthernet)**\n",
    "   - Interfaces are the router’s physical or virtual connections to the network. Assigning an IP address to an interface is necessary for communication.\n",
    "   - Enter interface configuration mode using **`interface FastEthernet0/0`** (or replace `FastEthernet0/0` with the appropriate interface type and number).\n",
    "   - Set an IP address with **`ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0`**, where `192.168.1.1` is the IP and `255.255.255.0` is the subnet mask.\n",
    "   - Use **`no shutdown`** to activate the interface. By default, interfaces are in a shutdown state until this command is issued.\n",
    "   - Use **`exit`** to leave the interface configuration mode.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### 7. **Setting Up a Default Gateway (Static Routing)**\n",
    "   - A **default gateway** is essential for directing packets that aren’t destined for the router’s local network.\n",
    "   - Set a default route with **`ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.254`**, where `192.168.1.254` is the IP address of the next hop (another router or a gateway).\n",
    "   - The IP route command tells the router where to send traffic when it doesn’t have a specific route for a destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Save the Configuration**\n",
    "   - To ensure that your configurations persist after a router restart, you need to save the changes from **running configuration** (RAM) to **startup configuration** (NVRAM).\n",
    "   - Use **`copy running-config startup-config`**. This saves your changes, so they’re loaded automatically the next time the router is restarted.\n",
    "   - If you don’t save, your configurations will be lost after a reboot, and the router will revert to its last saved configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Verify the Configuration**\n",
    "   - Use **`show`** commands to check and troubleshoot configurations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`show ip interface brief`**: This gives a summary of each interface, its IP address, and its status (whether it’s up or down).\n",
    "   - **`show running-config`**: Displays the current configuration in RAM, showing the commands that have been applied since the last reboot or since entering configuration mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Table with Detailed Descriptions\n",

    "| `ip route [network] [mask] [next-hop]` | Sets a static route, defining where packets should go if no specific route is known.       |\n",
    "| `show ip interface brief`         | Displays the IP address, status, and protocol information for each interface.                       |\n",
    "| `show running-config`             | Shows the current configuration, helpful for reviewing settings and making adjustments.             |\n",
    "| `copy running-config startup-config` | Saves the running configuration to be loaded after a restart, ensuring configurations are retained. |\n",
